<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->
# 📖 Hello Microverse <a name="about-project"></a>
> This is the first project as full time student.
> In this project, we will set up a "Hello world" repository. Goal here is to master all of the tools and best practices you learned about in previous steps. 
> You will be using them in all Microverse projects and most likely in your future job as well, so it is important to know them!
